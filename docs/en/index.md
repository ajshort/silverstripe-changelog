### Changelog Module

The Changelog module adds the ability to maintain a changelog for Versioned
DataObjects at both a record and field level, as well as at the field level
across `has_many` and `many_many` relations.

See [Usage](dev/docs/en/changelog/usage) for basic usage and configuration
options. The location of the repository and issue tracker can be found on the
[Links](dev/docs/en/changelog/links) page.
